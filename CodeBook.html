<h2>Original data and description of the variables</h2>

<p>The data sets that compose the original raw data we&#39;re going to use are contained in a zip archive. This zip archive contains the nest <em>.txt</em> archives with relevant data for us:</p>

<ul>
<li>&#39;features.txt&#39;: List of all features.</li>
<li>&#39;activity_labels.txt&#39;: Links the class labels with their activity name.</li>
<li>&#39;train/X_train.txt&#39;: Training set.</li>
<li>&#39;train/y_train.txt&#39;: Training labels.</li>
<li>&#39;test/X_test.txt&#39;: Test set.</li>
<li>&#39;test/y_test.txt&#39;: Test labels.</li>
<li>&#39;train/subject_train.txt&#39;: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.</li>
<li>&#39;test/subject_test.txt&#39;: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. </li>
</ul>

<p>For each record, that is the rows in <strong>X_train.txt</strong> and <strong>X_test.txt</strong>, it is provided:</p>

<ul>
<li>Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.</li>
<li>Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. </li>
<li>A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. </li>
<li>Its activity label. </li>
<li>An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary of the transformation of the data</h2>

<p>The precise steps followed to arrive to the final tidy data set are detailed at the <strong>README.md</strong> file. We summarize here just how we use the original files to generate the final archive, in case you&#39;re interested in the details, please read the <strong>README.md</strong> referenced file:</p>

<ol>
<li>We pass the data at <strong>features.txt</strong> as a header for the data contained in <strong>X_train.txt</strong> and <strong>X_test.txt</strong>.</li>
<li>Add as a new columns <strong>subject_train.txt</strong> and <strong>y_train.txt</strong> to the <strong>X_train.txt</strong> data. The same for the <strong>X_test.txt</strong>. Note that the activities (contained in the <strong>y_sowhatever.txt</strong> files) are referenced as indices.</li>
<li>We bind togheter <strong>X_train.txt</strong> and <strong>X_test.txt</strong> in an unique data set that contained all the data.</li>
<li>We use the information in <strong>activity_labels.txt</strong> to change the indices that refer to the different activities in the data set to descriptive activity names.</li>
<li>We filter the data to select just the variables we are interested in.</li>
<li>We agregate the data to generate a new table with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Appendix: Meaning of the data in the records</h2>

<p>The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix <strong>t</strong> to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. </p>

<p>Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). </p>

<p>Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the <strong>f</strong> to indicate frequency domain signals). </p>

<p>These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:<br/>
<strong>-XYZ</strong> is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.</p>

<ul>
<li>tBodyAcc-XYZ</li>
<li>tGravityAcc-XYZ</li>
<li>tBodyAccJerk-XYZ</li>
<li>tBodyGyro-XYZ</li>
<li>tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ</li>
<li>tBodyAccMag</li>
<li>tGravityAccMag</li>
<li>tBodyAccJerkMag</li>
<li>tBodyGyroMag</li>
<li>tBodyGyroJerkMag</li>
<li>fBodyAcc-XYZ</li>
<li>fBodyAccJerk-XYZ</li>
<li>fBodyGyro-XYZ</li>
<li>fBodyAccMag</li>
<li>fBodyAccJerkMag</li>
<li>fBodyGyroMag</li>
<li>fBodyGyroJerkMag</li>
</ul>

<p>The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: </p>

<ul>
<li>mean(): Mean value</li>
<li>std(): Standard deviation</li>
<li>mad(): Median absolute deviation </li>
<li>max(): Largest value in array</li>
<li>min(): Smallest value in array</li>
<li>sma(): Signal magnitude area</li>
<li>energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. </li>
<li>iqr(): Interquartile range </li>
<li>entropy(): Signal entropy</li>
<li>arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4</li>
<li>correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals</li>
<li>maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude</li>
<li>meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency</li>
<li>skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal </li>
<li>kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal </li>
<li>bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.</li>
<li>angle(): Angle between to vectors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:</p>

<ul>
<li>gravityMean</li>
<li>tBodyAccMean</li>
<li>tBodyAccJerkMean</li>
<li>tBodyGyroMean</li>
<li>tBodyGyroJerkMean</li>
</ul>
